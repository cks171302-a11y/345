## Overview
I am a member of the "Green@Community Recycling Network Analysis" team, evaluating Green@Community’s cost‑effectiveness to inform resource allocation. The EPD’s GREEN$ ePIS incentivises recycling at community and smart facilities—users can earn GREEN$ via the mobile app or a card, which can be redeemed for rewards or donated. For the enquiry, I defined measurable indicators (e.g., monthly/annual active users = those who earned GREEN$ at least once) to keep requests precise and actionable.

## Challenges
A major challenge was anticipating refusal: user demographics and operating costs are often confidential, and the EPD may not release detailed cost breakdowns. This revealed the fragility of relying solely on official datasets. To mitigate this risk, I prepared alternatives, such as estimating total operating costs from staff counts, working hours, and equipment inventories, and collecting proxy measures like visitor counts and brief on‑site surveys.

## Why it matters
This work matters because data access directly shapes what participatory policy analysis can recommend. When direct disclosure is limited, transparent proxy methods and defensible estimates still enable evidence‑based suggestions for resource allocation, facility placement, and outreach. The process strengthened my skills in formal enquiry design, adaptive analysis, and communicating constraints alongside recommendations.

## Practical takeaway
Combine precise enquiries, AI‑assisted drafting, and pragmatic proxy data to produce credible, usable policy advice.
